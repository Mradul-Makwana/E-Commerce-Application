### Project Status: On Hold ðŸš§

Dear Visitors,

I deeply appreciate your interest in this project. Unfortunately, due to financial constraints, I am unable to continue using Amazon AWS services for this application at this time. As a student/developer with limited resources, I rely on free tiers to bring my ideas to life.

This project remains under development, and I am actively seeking alternatives to AWS to resume progress. If you have suggestions for cost-effective solutions or wish to collaborate, feel free to reach out.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,  
Mradul Makwana
